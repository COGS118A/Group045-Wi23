    "This paper presents a method of classifying galaxies using two-dimensional \n",

    "using supervised machine learning for galaxy type classification. Utilizing \n",
    "MaNGA two-dimensional  spectra data, although its original goal is to \n",
    "understand life history of our present day galaxies, our approach employs a \n",
    "novel approach with an attempt to classify galaxies' morphological shapes. \n",
    "The performance of the proposed classification model is evaluated using an \n",
    "extensive dataset of MaNGA spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and \n",
    "labeled galaxies' shapes from the Galaxy Zoo 1. Instead of using filters from \n",
    "a Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture to train, we will reduce our \n",

    "When you look up into the sky, there are thousands of stars that are \n",

    "1% of a percent of the stars in our galaxy (Actually its less than a \n",
    "thousanth of that, if you include all stars visible throughout the year). \n",
    "Beyond these stars, and even beyond our galaxy are billions of other \n",
    "galaxies that are similarly vast to our own milkyway. The Hubble Space \n",
    "Telescope famously took a long exposure of one of the darkest areas of the \n",
    "sky, and produced \n",
    "[a beautiful image](https://web.archive.org/web/20230222000000/https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/multimedia/wfpc/deep-field.html) \n",
    "showing many many speckles, all of which were very distant galaxies. \n",
    "\n",
    "These galaxies can be divided into a few categories based on their visual \n",
    "shape, allowing for categorization and study of similar galaxies and how they \n",
    "formed and evolve over the vast lifespan of the universe. There are two main \n",
    "categories: Spiral and Elliptical galaxies. These two categories can be \n",
    "further divided into how elliptical and how well defined the spiral arms are, \n",
    "resulting in a total of [11 subcategories](https://esahubble.org/images/heic9902o/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Research:\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxies have previously been categorized en-mas using low resolution spectral \n",
    "information (ie: broad color filters), with crowdsourced shape identification \n",
    "through the project \\[Galaxy Zoo\\]. Previous attempts have been made to train \n",
    "a classifier on the 3 color images and shapes with moderate to low success \n",
    "[\\[B\\]](https://youtu.be/H6UBjbio5-A). In this project we plan to apply these \n",
    "techniques to classify galaxies based on high resolution spectral data from the \n",
    "MaNGA Survey (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spectra?\n",
    "Objects that emit light emit light in a range of wavelengths that are precieved \n",
    "by humans as different colors. Different objects produce, absorb, and reflect \n",
    "light at different wavelengths differently in characteristic ways that can tell \n",
    "information about a source.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part there are two main production methods: One, when any object \n",
    "is heated up, it has general emissions over a broad range of wavelengths, known \n",
    "as black-body radiation. And the other is when various gasses are ionized and \n",
    "changing energy states, when electrons fall back into lower energy states, they \n",
    "release photons of energy at very specific wavelengths that corrospond exactly \n",
    "with the energy released by the electron. These create spectral lines: a large \n",
    "concentration of light intensity in a small band of wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this process also has its opposite: when that wavelength passes through \n",
    "a material that would emit at that wavelength, that material can absorb that \n",
    "light in the opposite process as the creation of spectral lines. These are \n",
    "called {spectral }, and they, in addition to physically blocking light (like \n",
    "dust or a solid rock), are how most light is attenuated. Most spectra are \n",
    "primarily made up of these features, and can be used to determine the \n",
    "tempurature and chemical makeup of the source that emitted that light. \n",
    "\n",
    "Humans only have 4 kinds of light sensing cells (three for color and one for \n",
    "luminance) that are sensetive to a very small portion of the spectrum, and \n",
    "thus can't view anything outside of that small range. But even within that \n",
    "range, only having three sensors means there is low spectral information. \n",
    "Technology has provided us with a way to measure precise spectra: the \n",
    "spectrograph. A spectrograph can measure the exact intensitites at very precice \n",
    "wavelengths of light, allowing for a lot of information to be gleaned about the \n",
    "source. \n",
    "\n",
    "The survey that we are using (MaNGA) has collected spectra for {hundreds of \n",
    "thousands} of galaxies, which are corrolated with that galaxy's history and makeup, \n",
    "which is also corrolated with the galaxy's shape. Thus we can use these spectral \n",
    "readings of these galaxies to hopefully make predictions about their shapes."

    "Galaxy classification is a difficult task due to the large number of galaxies \n",
